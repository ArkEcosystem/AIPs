# Abstract

In order to move forward with the ark blockchain for future evolution, the transaction protocol needs to be upgraded.
Comment thread: https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/AIPs/issues/11

# Motivation

The current status of protocol has several limitations that prevent from future development of services as envisioned on the roadmap:

- impossibility to have cost efficient deserialisation, preventing from scalability of the network
- `retention-replay` attack: a third part can prevent transaction from hitting blockchain inducing the transaction author to create a new transaction. However the transaction is still valid and could be included in the blockchain whenever in the future
- impossible to upgrade transactions without hard fork / no support for private transactions
- impossible to scale fees following the market price

# Rationale

- Fast serialisation and deserialisation
- Compatible with former version of protocol (0xff head flag)
- Lay groundwork for future upgrade without the need of a fork
- Able to validate custom private transactions
- Prevent “retention-replay” attack scheme

# Specifications

**All numbers are stored as unsigned Least Endian forms.**

## General form (total header size excluding vendorfield: 50 bytes)

| Description        | Size (bytes) | Example                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| header             | 1            | 0xff                                                                 |
| version            | 1            | 0x02                                                                 |

| type               | 1            | 0x00                                                                 |
| nonce/timestamp    | 4            | 0x00293fa0                                                           |
| sender public key  | 33           | 0x025f81956d5826bad7d30daed2b5c8c98e72046c1ec8323da336445476183fb7ca |

| vendorfield length | 1            | 0x0e                                                                 |
| vendorfield        | 0-255        | 0x7468697320697320612074657374                                       |
| payload            | variable     | see details below                                                    |

In application, nonce is equivalent as formerly known timestamp and can be used.
Version 0x01 will be notifying former use of protocol to serialise the tx before computing signatures.

## Payloads

The payload is defined according to the type of the transaction. This may be changed with a version change in the future.

**Type 0 (transfer, 33bytes)**

| Description       | Size (bytes) | Example                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| amount            | 8            | 0x8096980000000000                           |
| expiration        | 4            | 0x04000000 (0x00000000 = no expiration)      |
| recipient address | 21           | 0x171dfc69b54c7fe901e91d5a9ab78388645e2427ea |

Expiration is the timestamp after which it cannot be included in a block.
In other words, if the block timestamp is strictly superior to the transaction expiration timestamp, the transaction is invalid.

**Type 1 (second signature registration, 33 bytes)**

| Description                    | Size (bytes) | Example                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public key of second signature | 33           | 0x025f81956d5826bad7d30daed2b5c8c98e72046c1ec8323da336445476183fb7ca |

**Type 2 (delegate registration, 1 + 3-20 bytes)**

| Description     | Size (bytes) | Example                           |
| --------------- | ------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| length          | 1            | 0x10 (minimum 0x03, maximum 0x14) |
| username (utf8) | 3-20         | 0x6669786372797074                |

**Type 3 (vote, 1 + 34N bytes)**

| Description     | Size (bytes) | Example                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number of votes | 1            | 0x02                                                                                                                                       |
| votes           | 34\*N        | 0x0103a02b9d5fdd1307c2ee4652ba54d492d1fd11a7d1bb3f3a44c4a05e79f19de933000380728436880a0a11eadf608c4d4e7f793719e044ee5151074a5f2d5d43cb9066 |

`Votes` is a concatenation of votes of the form

- Vote flag (0x01 if vote, 0x00 if unvote)
- Public key of the delegate
  In the case of ark only there is only one possible vote, so the payload is maximum 35 bytes.

**Type 4 (multisignature registration, 3 + 33N bytes)**

| Description          | Size (bytes) | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Public keys          | 33\*N        | 0x03a02b9d5fdd1307c2ee4652ba54d492d1fd11a7d1bb3f3a44c4a05e79f19de9330380728436880a0a11eadf608c4d4e7f793719e044ee5151074a5f2d5d43cb906603a02b9d5fdd1307c2ee4652ba54d492d1fd11a7d1bb3f3a44c4a05e79f19de933 |

`Public keys` are the concatenation of public keys of the people signing on this account.

**Type 5 (IPFS, 1 + 0-255 bytes)**

| Description   | Size (bytes) | Example            |
| ------------- | ------------ | :----------------- |
| Length of dag | 1            | 0xea               |
| dag           | 0-255        | 0x6669786372797074 |

**Type 6 (timelock transfer 34 bytes)**

| Description       | Size (bytes) | Example                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| amount            | 8            | 0x8096980000000000                           |
| timelock type     | 1            | 0x00 (timestamp), 0x01 (blockheight)         |
| timelock          | 4            | 0x0087e5a8                                   |
| recipient address | 21           | 0x171dfc69b54c7fe901e91d5a9ab78388645e2427ea |

`Timelock type` defines different types for `timelock` value field (current supported types are `0:for timestamp type` timelock and `1:for blockheight type` timelock value). If timelock type=0, timelock value shall be specified with timestamp, and if type=1, timelock value shall be specified with blockheight.

- TimeLockType=0, timelock value=timestamp: transaction will be forged when timestamp is passed
- TimeLockType=1, timelock value=blockHeight: transaction will be forged when blockchain reaches height specified at timelock value for blockHeight

**Type 7 (multipayment, 2-65546 bytes)**

| Description | Size (bytes) | Example                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| N outputs   | 2            | 0x0021                                       |
| amount1     | 8            | 0x8096980000000000                           |
| address1    | 21           | 0x171dfc69b54c7fe901e91d5a9ab78388645e2427ea |
| ...         | ...          | ...                                          |
| amountN     | 8            | 0x8096980000000000                           |
| addressN    | 21           | 0x171dfc69b54c7fe901e91d5a9ab78388645e2427ea |

- N > 1 (ideally fees should be higher than type 0 if N < 2)
- Max 2259 possible outputs. first versions of network will cap this max

**Type 8 (delegate resignation)**

| Description | Size (bytes) | Example |
| ----------- | ------------ | :------ |
| No payload  | 0            | .       |

basically this will make:

- impossible to vote for this delegate anymore
- impossible to be selected as active delegate

## Dynamic Fees calculation

> see [AIP-16](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/AIPs/blob/master/AIPS/aip-16.md) for more detailed information.

A new process will be used where the fee is related to:

- Type of the transaction
- Size of the serialised transaction

The calculation formula is `Fee = (T+S) * C`

- T: minimum offset byte depending on transaction type, defined by the network (byte)
- S: size of the serialised transaction (byte)
- C: constant (Ark/byte) defined by the delegate including the transaction in his forged block

For instance, for transfer we could have T = 0 byte, C = 0.0001 Ark/byte. For a classic transfer transaction with empty VendorField S = 80 bytes, hence the fee is 0.008 Ark.

For a vote we could have T = 100 bytes, C=0.0001 Ark/byte, S = 82 bytes, fee = 0.0182 Ark

T is here to account for extra processing power to process special transaction whose transfer value is null, and thus reducing economic interest to spam the network.
