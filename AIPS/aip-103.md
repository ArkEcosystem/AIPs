# Marketplace Transaction Types

A team or a company will be able to issue a business/bridgechain registration transaction in the same way a delegate registration transaction is issued. The proposed fee for this transaction should be in the level of delegate registration ARK as it relates to a similar process, however as this introduces more data being stored on mainnet, we should take spam protection into consideration (fees, rules). We will also add ability to terminate business or bridgechain via a special transaction type (reason: for new projects or companies to use the non-claimed chain ticker, business name). 

## Prerequisites:
AIP-29.

## General Features:

### Hardware limitations
Size limitations related to size of specifics fields, that can go into the additional assets. We must be careful and limit every incoming field to avoid simple and cheap attack issues on the mainnet - which would result in size/spam increase.

### Processing Limits
1. Strict schema validation
2. Ensure checks on transaction pool and protocol level (see specs for each transaction type)

Check below for specification of new transaction types. We are introducing the following transaction types: 

1. BusinessRegistration
2. BusinessResignation
3. BusinessUpdate
4. BridgeChainRegistration
5. BridgeChainResignation
6. BridgechainUpdate

# 1.BusinessRegistration Transaction

Name: **BusinessRegistration**


## Fields:

| Field                        | Size(bytes) | Requires |
| --------                     | --------    | -------- |
| name                         | 40          |    Y     |
| website                      | 50          |    Y     |
| vat                          | 15          |    Y     |
| organizationRepository       | 50          |    Y     |


We allow UTF8, for all that strange chars and names. 


```ts=
export const businessProperties = {
    name: {
        type: "string",
        minLength: 1,
        maxLength: 40,
    },
    website: {
        type: "string",
        minLength: 4,
        maxLength: 50,
    },
    vat: {
        type: "string",
        minLength: 8,
        maxLength: 15,
    },
    organizationRepository: {
        type: "string",
        minLength: 11,
        maxLength: 50,
    },
};
```

Asset interface definition
```ts=
export interface IBusinessRegistrationAsset {
    name: string;
    website: string;
    vat?: string;
    organizationRepository?: string;
}
```

## Transaction Processing:
Add BusinessInformation to wallets, so we can identify them and access the latest data.

### Verify
- All normal rules from GTI handlers (signature, serde process, pool security,...)
- Size limitations of specific fields
- Schema validation of some fields

### Apply
- add state to wallet (Business)

### CannotBeApplied
- If business is already registered

### Fees   
- We MUST enforce a high static fee ~ 50 ARK
- Expand the protocol, so that only static fee is accepted


# 2. BusinessResignation Transaction

Name: **BusinessResignation**

A Business can terminate its registration, if itâ€™s no longer operational or working. The reasoning behind this is to make posible for wallet to issue BusinessRegistration again.

## Transaction Processing:

### Verify
- All normal rules from GTI handlers (signature, serde process, pool security,...)
- Only a registered business can issue this transaction type.

### Apply
- Add state to wallet (`resigned`) 
- All bridgechain are resigned

### CannotBeApplied
- If wallet doesn't have business state
- If business has been resigned

### Fees
- Normal transfer fee
 

# 3. BusinessUpdate Transaction

A Business can update its business asset stored in wallet.


## Fields:

| Field                        | Size(bytes) | Requires |
| --------                     | --------    | -------- |
| name                         | 40          |    N     |
| website                      | 50          |    N     |
| vat                          | 15          |    N     |   
| organizationRepository       | 50          |    N     |

```ts=
export interface IBusinessUpdateAsset {
    name?: string;
    website?: string;
    vat?: string;
    organizationRepository?: string;
}
```

## Transaction Processing:

### Verify
- All normal rules from GTI handlers (signature, serde process, pool security,...)
- Only a registered business can issue this transaction type.

### Apply
- Allowed fields are updated during the apply logic

### CannotBeApplied
- If business doesn't have business state
- If business has been resigned

### Fees
- We enforce static fee of 25 ARK

# 4. BridgeChainRegistration Transaction

Name: **BridgeChainRegistration**

Only a registered business can issue a bridgechain registration transaction. 

## Fields:

| Field                            | Size(bytes) | Requires |
| --------                         | --------    | -------- |
| name                             | 40          |    Y     |
| seedNodes                        | 400         |    Y     |
| genesisHash                      | 33          |    Y     |
| bridgechainRepository            | 50          |    Y     |

```ts=
export interface IBridgechainRegistrationAsset {
    name: string;
    seedNodes: string[];
    genesisHash: string;
    bridgechainRepository: string;
}


export interface IBridgechainWalletProperty {
    bridgechain: IBridgechainRegistrationAsset;
    registrationTransactionId: string;
    bridgechainNonce?: number;
    resigned?: boolean;
}

```

```ts=
export const registeredBridgechainIdProperty = {
    type: "string",
    minLength: 64,
    maxLength: 64,
    $ref: "transactionId",
};

export const seedNodesProperties = {
    type: "array",
    maxItems: 10,
    minItems: 1,
    uniqueItems: true,
    items: {
        type: "string",
        required: ["ip"],
        properties: {
            ip: {
                oneOf: [
                    {
                        type: "string",
                        format: "ipv4",
                    },
                    {
                        type: "string",
                        format: "ipv6",
                    },
                ],
            },
        },
    },
};

```

## Transaction Processing:

### Verify

- All normal rules from GTI handlers (signature, serde process, pool security,...)
- Only a registered business can issue this transaction type. If address has not issued a BusinessTransaction yet, it should be rejected.
- Size limitations of specific fields
- Max number of input seeds (~10)

### Apply

- Add bridgechain details to **BusinessRegistered** wallets (core-state), so we can list them and access the latest data specified data
- Bridgechain nonce introduction - we apply a bridgechain nonce to every registered bridgechain. Bridgechain nonce is coupled with `TransactionType` group (see AIP-20) and allows dynamic numbering and validation of `cross-chain` transaction types, thus avoiding duplication of ids.

### CannotBeApplied

- If wallet doesn't have business state
- If wallet has resigned as a business

### Fees   

- We MUST enforce a high static fee ~ 25 ARK
- Expand the protocol, so that only static fee is accepted

# 5. BridgeChainResignation Transaction

A Business can terminate one of its bridgechain registrations. Registration transaction ID needs to be provided for the exact bridgechain that is resigning.

Name: **BridgeChainResignation**


## Fields:

| Field                            | Size(bytes) | Requires |
| --------                         | --------    | -------- |
| registrationTransactionId        |    33       |    Y     |


```ts=
export interface IBridgechainResignationAsset {
    registeredBridgechainId: string;
}
```

```ts=
export const registeredBridgechainIdProperty = {
    type: "string",
    minLength: 64,
    maxLength: 64,
    $ref: "transactionId",
};
```

## Transaction Processing:

### Verify

- All normal rules from GTI handlers (signature, serde process, pool security,...)
- Only a registered business can issue this transaction type 
- We need to define the ID of bridgechain we are resigning

### Apply
- Add `resigned` flag to wallet

### CannotBeApplied
- If specified birdgechain is already resigned
- If wallet is not a business
- If wallet has resigned as a business

### Fees
- Normal dynamic transfer fee

# 6. BridgeChainUpdate Transaction

A Business can update bridgechain registrations (if it is the same owning wallet). During the update process we can only update/add additional seedNodes to the process.

## Fields

| Field                            | Size(bytes) | Requires |
| --------                         | --------    | -------- |
| registeredBridgechainId          |    33       |    Y     |
| seedNodes                        |    array[]  |    Y     |


```ts=
export interface IBridgechainUpdateAsset {
    registeredBridgechainId: string;
    seedNodes: string[];
}
```
### Verify
- SeedNodes schema validation

### Apply
- Update bridgechain seedNodes in wallet state

### CannotBeApplied
- If specified birdgechain is already resigned
- If wallet is not a business
- If wallet has resigned as a business

### Fees

- We MUST enforce a high static fee ~ 25 ARK


For `seedNodes` update - same rules are aplied as with bridgeChain registration transaction type.

> Final decision and specifics will be adjusted by project lead and aligned during actual implementation.
