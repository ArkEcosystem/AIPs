## Abstract
Crytpcurrencies are expected to gain adoption and with that their token value should appreciate over time. As a result holders of these cryptocurrencies become juicy targets for hackers and malicious entities. Covenants are a special construct that allows specifying restrictions on how the covenant address can spend tokens in the future. This AIP proposes a new transaction type that can be used to implement covenants in Ark.

## Motivation
In order to understand the issue in depth we have to first discuss the current approaches to cold storage and the game theoretic incentives involved for malicious entities.
In the current paradigm an individual must create an address from a randomly generated secret passphrase. This passphrase has to be stored safely and the owner may lose all control over their account in case the passphrase is leaked. As a result holders of cryptocurrencies become prime targets for hackers and in the event of a hack they have no recourse to protect themselves after the fact. From a hacker's perspective each holder of cryptocurrency represents potential profit sources as the chance of a hack succeeding is non-zero and once a target has been hacked they are unable to nullify the transaction.

This AIP, inspired by the bitcoin covenants approach by [Möser et al.](https://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/MES16.pdf), introduces a transaction type with parameters that allow the owner of the address to define restrictions upon creation of the covenant which specify how the address can spend outgoing transactions, or as a last resort burn a previously sent unconfirmed transaction in order to ensure that a potential hacker doesn't benefit from it. Since covenant addresses can be identified publicly any potential attacker will know that there is no profit to be made by attacking the owner of the address and that even in the case of a successful hack the amount extracted will be burned by the owner. This knowledge acts as a deterrent against hacking attempts and allows creation of a truly secure cold storage address.

Covenants can also be used to setup dead-man switches which are useful to pass on the owner's wealth to predefined heirs without involving any legal custodian or intermediary in the event of an untimely demise.

## Specification
The detailed steps involved are as follows:


## Rationale

## Backwards Compatibility
(Will be updated once appropriate)
All AIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The AIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. AIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Reference Implementation
(Will be updated once appropriate)
The reference implementation must be completed before any AIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the AIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Ark protocol.
