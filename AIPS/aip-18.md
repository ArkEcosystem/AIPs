Abstract
========

This AIP is the description of the multisignature protocol. The current one, the flaws and the proposed improvements.

Rationale
=========
The multisignature scheme is different from the classic scheme in Bitcoin (p2sh script) or in Ethereum (smart contract). Indeed, the multisignature is seen as the combination of 2 transactions:
- multisignature registration transaction (type 4),
- normal transactions where the needed signatures are added to authorize the multisignature transaction to be included in a block.

This protocol has the advantage over p2sh or smart contract in term of governance: if the protocol is flawed, the responsibility is not from the smart-contract or p2sh author, but from the initial code, thus pushing the responsibility to fix and reimburse the damages of the flaw to the community.

In essence the multisignature registration transaction contains the set of public keys, the signatures of the owners of these keys and the parameters of the multisign (minimum signatures in m/n as well as lifetime).

Limitations:
- multisignatures are not upgradeable,
- multisignatures cannot be resigned,
- multisignatures contain one single public key owner to conform to normal addressing system,
- lifetime parameter does not prevent from performing filling attacks on the transaction pool.

Improvements:
The proposed improvement tries to solve the above issues describing a protocol to make multisignature transaction much more usable as the current legacy system inherited from Lisk. There is also a discussion to integrate "Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin" as described by Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin and Pieter Wuille here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068

Specifications
==============

Legacy protocol:
- Rule 1 - multisign registration: `ownerPublickey` (from where the address is derived), list of committing public keys (N), `lifetime` (from 1 to 72 hours), `min` minimum (0 < M < N+1), list of N signatures.
- Rule 2 - transaction acceptance: minimum of M different signatures corresponding to different committing public keys should be included into the transaction.
- Rule 3 - if not enough signatures are present, the transaction is stocked into the transaction pool for `lifetime` hours until enough signatures are sent via the API - this rule is Lisk legacy ans has been removed from the beginning.

New protocol:
- `lifetime` is removed from protocol together with above rule 3.
- The sender's wallet is no longer modified, instead a multi signature registration creates a new wallet
- The multi signature wallet's public key `pkms` is derived as follows:
    - create a public key from the seed `hex(min)`
    - add together all public keys (`concat(pkMin + pk1 + ... + pkn)`)
    - the order of public keys is not important
- The multi signature address is then derived as usual `base58_check(version + hash160(pkms))` 
- In order to remove funds, outgoing transactions have to be signed by `min` participants
- The signatures scheme is the combo (i, Si) (`i` being the index of the ith public key in the multi signature asset), so it is fast to verify against the right Pk
- In theory n-of-n multi signature wallets can leverage the `MuSig` algorithm making it possible to hide all participants (a sophisticated ritual)
