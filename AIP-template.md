## Preamble
RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the AIP, including the AIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

## Abstract
Short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Copyright
Each AIP must be licensed under the MIT License.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change the Ark protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All AIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The AIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. AIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Reference Implementation
The reference implementation must be completed before any AIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the AIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Ark protocol.
